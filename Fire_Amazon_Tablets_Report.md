### Product 2: AmazonBasics USB 3.0 Cable - A-Male to B-Male - 6 Feet (1.8 Meters)
**Summary**: This is a good length cable for those that don't want tight connections because a cable is too short. This particular AmazonBasics USB 3.0 cable is 9 feet long and delivers full bandwidth between my Mac and my external hard drive. The cable is sturdy and is gold plated for better connectivity (I assume that helps. There is no real way to test that at home).The cables are priced similarly to competitors. The nice thing about it being an Amazon product is that I am sure the return policy would be simple and quick.

### Product 3: Cat Litter Box Covered Tray Kitten Extra Large Enclosed Hooded Hidden Toilet
**Summary**: I replaced my cat's x-large litter box to this smaller sized litter box... It's easy to clean and takes less kitty litter to fill it which I like. Great price, good value! I love this litter box. I've used it for a year and a half and it's still in good working order. It's a great value for money. I love it. I have used this box for a years and a week. I'm still in love with it.
