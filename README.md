# Amazon Review Sentiment & Clustering Project

This project focuses on analyzing and classifying customer reviews from Amazon. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for sentiment classification and clustering of reviews. The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Sentiment Classification**: Classifying customer reviews as positive or negative using machine learning models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa.
2. **Review Clustering**: Grouping reviews into categories using clustering techniques based on their content.
